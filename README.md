# Phonebook-App

This is a phonebook app that I have been working on as I have been learning React from a "FullStack Web Development" course from the University of Helesinki.
It is very basic but it is one of my first attempts of coding. Recently, I have been learning node.express to make custom api's. This is shown in the index.js 
folder. 

So essentially this is simply working on routing. If you go to the Phonebook-App repository and download the folder, you can "npm run dev" and this will show you what I have been working on. I have learned about routing, and a bit of what the course calls "the back end".
